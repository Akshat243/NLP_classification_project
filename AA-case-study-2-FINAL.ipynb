Difficulty breathing still during the day until I took a Zyrtec.\", \"April 16: Thursday.  During the night, I sweat out twice.  2 t-shirts and 2 damp sweaters. I\\u2019m wearing sweaters to bed.   Slept soundly. No breathing problems. Felt a little lightheaded in the morning.  I felt a slight slight headache coming on late last night but it dissipated.\", \"April 17: Friday.  Night Slight difficulty breathing but only slight discomfort.  I didn\\u2019t feel like I was suffocating \\u2013 surprising considering the circumstances of everything.  Too zyrtec and did inhaler.  Slept from about 1 am to 5 am. Some slight numbness in both of my big toes that I could shake off. No cough.  No fever. No headache. To my knowledge, no night sweats. This marks Day 7 of possible symptoms. Have a metallic taste in my mouth. 2 pm:  breathing problems started again.  Perhaps because of the cold air.  Did inhaler around 2 pm. 4 pm \\u2013 a huge chunk of phlegm crept up out of my chest, deep center, without as much as a cough.  Called nurse at Northwestern. She thinks that is a good thing. Feeling much better as a result with my breathing. I was concerned that it might be a sign of pneumonia \\u2013 but no.\", \"April 18: Saturday Slept well. No issues. 1 big sweat as I recall \\u2013 but drank several cups of hot water prior to bed.  Picked up Mucinex from Walgreens (face covered by mask and towel except when outside \\u2013 stupidly talked on the phone wtihout my mask over my mouth but luckily it was windy and people were at least 10 feet from me). Came back.  Felt slight numbness in my left foot.  Felt metallic taste in my mouth again when drinking hot water.  Sharp metallic.  Drank several cups of water. Still feeling ok as of 11:45 am. Around 1 pm, the slight difficulty started in my breathing.  Took a shower. Took some Mucinex. Needie pottie.  Not as bad as other days but still uncomfortable. I don\\u2019t need to breathe as quickly as previous days to get air in my lungs. Plus the phlegm is liquid in the shower steam. Other days it wouldn\\u2019t even budge.  Smell /taste is fine.  Haven\\u2019t taken zyrtec since last night at 8 pm. Took a sharp turn for the worst around 2:30 pm due to stress.  I felt it return in the upper left, upper right and center.  I tightness I hadn\\u2019t felt for days. I couldn\\u2019t get my lungs to fill with a deep breath.  It\\u2019s as if I went back 2+ days. 3 pm Mucinex. 5:30 pm Zyrtec. 6 pm 2 puffs of inhaler. By 8 pm, the breathing had relaxed and back to more normal \\u2013 though there is still tightness in the upper part.   It has returned there.  But I\\u2019m not having to take a breath every 2 seconds to get air into my lungs. It\\u2019s fairly normal \\u2013 or more normal than it was. I\\u2019ll keep drinking water. Got bad again around 9 pm and was bad all night long. Took 2 more puffs of inhaler at 10:30 pm.\", \"April 19: Sunday Day 10 Slept horribly Tough to get a breath.  2 hours sleep. Breathing is a little easier this morning around 7 am. Took Zyrtec at 8 am. My breathing eased immediately.   For the rest of the day.  And all night. The torture of the day and night before was gone.\", \"Monday 20, Day 11:  Slept easily all night long. Had a little sore throat this morning. Left big toe a little numb as I sit and type. Took Zyrtec by mistake around 7-8 am. Drank green tea which loosened up slightly but not enough to get the solidified congestion out of my lungs.  I still need to get the solidified congetsion out. Difficulty breathing around 6 pm. Lightheadness uneasy in the legs around 8 pm. Emergency room at 10 pm.\", \"Tuesday April 21: Slept soundly after returning from ER at 2:30 am. Woke up around 8:30 am. Drank far less water. Ate Chinese food. Drank gatorade to get my sodium levels back up.  Feel good. Around 8 pm. A little sore throat in the back.  Throat/sinus. Might be the sugar from the chinese food. Or gluten. We\\u2019ll see.\", \"Wednesday April 22. DAY 13!!! (Potentially \\u2013 my antibody test may show negative and this whole thing might have been due too much water and too much vitamin C and too low Sodium. No problems breathing at all. No other symptoms. No sweats \\u2013 nothing.  I got out and walked to Giordano\\u2019s up on Sheridan and Pratt maybe. I thought I might have problems after I ate oatmeal \\u2013 a little bloated and breathing heavy but that quicky corrected itself.\", \"Sunday, April 26:  No breathing problems to speak of since Wednesday.  A little problems at the hotel in Schaumburg \\u2013 the Marriott.  We walked through grass and the pollen was high.  Some benadryl took care of it.
